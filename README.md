# FATAR-MIDI-KEYBOARD
 Daughter board for fatar keybed.
 
[FATAR](http://www.fatar.com/) makes an extremely rugged 44-key keyboard with weighted keys. It is the most natural feeling key-bed that resembles an actual grand paino in a small footprint. 

The goal of this project is to use this keybed as a user interface a future modular synth. It follows the [midi protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) and then is HEAVILY influenced by [elkayem's midi2cv project](https://github.com/elkayem/midi2cv) to convert this midi signal to various control voltages. It is all ported onto a single PCB which connects directly to the prexisting fatar pcb.
